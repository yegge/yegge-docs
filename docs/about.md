Balancing a professional career, artistic pursuits, and family life, Brian emphasizes the importance of not rushing the creative process. He rides the waves of inspiration when they come and shifts focus when they wane, allowing his creativity to flow naturally. His role at UTHealth funds his passions for music and photography, enabling him to fully invest in his interests.
