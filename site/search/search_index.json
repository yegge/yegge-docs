DISCOGRAPHY\u2028 DATABASE to be created for the purpose of display of my catalog.  It will also serve as an organizational tool on the back end to help define progress and show where progress needs to be made, this is measured by the track as defined in the logic below. An admin panel and view is required with an easy to use interface to update the storage and the databases. The domain is yegge.com, the admin site could be yegge.com/admin, the files will be accessible across a total of three domains, yegge.com. angershade.com, thecorruptive.com.  \u2028THE DATA\u2028 This will be a relational database of music and metadata.  There will be one catalog each in two parts.  The DISCOGRAPHY/database will consist of both published music and works in progress with PUBLIC VIEW restrictions, a VIP view with restrictions, and an admin view with NO Restrictions, along with an admin panel for entering the data.  The PUBLIC VIEW will have subviews that are determined by the Album Artist field, example, Angershade.com will only show the albums listed under the ALBUM ARTIST \u201cAngershade\u201d same for thecorruptive.com to show \u201cThe Corruptive\u201d.
